# Meritous-3ds
Port of the game Meritous to 3ds


This game is compiled using SDL 1.2 for 3ds after making small changes to the original code for running it on the 3ds in 3ds (Only addewd the 3ds romfs to store resources in the executable and changed to static to big arrays defined not globally to avoid a stack overflow).
